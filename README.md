# 474_Flappy_Bird
Flappy Bird is a game where the player controls the "bird" and has two actions to take
when the game is running: hitting the screen makes the bird jump vertically, and when not taking
action, the bird falls according to in-game gravity. The goal of the bird is to through pipes to stay
in flight and get a higher score. The bird successfully passes through each pipe, and the score is
incremented. The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or hits the ground. In this project,
the problem we want to solve is that we want to apply various reinforcement learning algorithms
to train an agent to play Flappy Bird. Then the agent can control bird to get more points or even
not die. Specifically, the approaches we use are Q-Learning, SARSA, and Deep Q-Learning.
